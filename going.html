    <code>My interest in pursuing a career in tech hatched out of a long love affair with video games. I used to game a lot, especially back in high school and college. After realizing I wasn't very excited about my previous career in marketing, I started to think about things that I'm passionate about, and computers and tech definitely fit the bill. I'm super excited about the opportunity to stop being just a consumer of technology but also an active creator of technology.</code>
