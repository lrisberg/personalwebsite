    <code>Hello! I'm Lauren. I grew up in the Bay Area and I've been living in Boulder for just over two years. I studied psychology at a small liberal arts college in Southern California. After graduating, I moved out here for my first job doing customer support and marketing for a women's health startup in Boulder. </code>

    <code>I love cooking up plants in dozens of delicious, healthy ways. My favorite foods are probably a three-way tie between peanuts, cilantro, and tofu. I'm passionate about animal rights and have been vegan for about two years. When I'm not cooking or thinking about food, I enjoy gardening and learning new things.</code>
